# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Our Titanic survival prediction project employs different Python libraries. We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, exploring passenger demographics, ticket class, and survival outcomes. Visualizations created with Seaborn offer insights into the distribution of passengers by gender and the count of survivors and non-survivors.
# Iris Flower Classification Project
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset, a popular choice for introductory classification tasks, is used for this project. The dataset consists of measurements for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The objective is to train machine learning models that can accurately predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.
# Movie Rating Prediction
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. The IMDb Movies India dataset is used for this project, which contains information about movies released in India.
