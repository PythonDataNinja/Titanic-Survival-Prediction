# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Our Titanic survival prediction project employs different Python libraries. We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, exploring passenger demographics, ticket class, and survival outcomes. Visualizations created with Seaborn offer insights into the distribution of passengers by gender and the count of survivors and non-survivors.
